### Challenges
Color Scheme:  
- The logo is bright shades of Red and Yellow, which gave me design issues.  
- In other words, I had to deviate from my usual color strategy. I ended up finding a nice shade of blue that complemented the red nicely, and I left the yellow mostly to highlights and accents. However, I still think I can do a better job of including yellow in the design.  
  
Images:  
- Working with images where the height was greater than the width posed some unique design challenges. I am also waiting on more images, and for now have to work with what I have.  
- It did teach me a lot of tricks when working with images, I feel like

### Future Goals:
Images:
- Get more images, make them look better on the website than the current ones  
Sections:  
- Create more sections, get concrete on what pages and sections he wants in the final product
Mobile Navigation:  
- Redesign the mobile nav-drawer to be more aesthetically pleasing
Contact Form:  
- Make cleaner, add more accessibility options

For Fun:  
- Make this into a React.js webpage. Lol
