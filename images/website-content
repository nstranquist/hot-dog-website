## About Section:

"Teddy’s Red Hots… An “All American Tradition":

"The key to our success here at Teddy’s Red Hots has always been providing our patrons with the freshest and tastiest “eats” made with the finest quality ingredients.  Since 1974, “Papa” Teddy diligently labored over what is now our famous Italian Beef recipe.  Three generations of our family now work hard to preserve the integrity of his philosophy, which is to never precook or use preservatives in anything.  As enticing as our menu may be, there is more that draws generations of customers to our two southwest suburban venues      
Voted favorite fast food eatery by many outstanding food critics, renowned reporters, and customers young and old, we simply are an “All American Tradition”.

…an exhilarating dining experience!                                                                    

    Our distinctive signature 7” hot dogs are pure beef, steamed or charred and packed with your favorite condiments and toppings.  They are now also served on a mouth watering gourmet pretzel bun everyone is raving about.
    Over 35 years of experience and the family patriarch’s recipe have come to together to offer a truly succulent Italian Beef sandwich. Our meat is choice, lean, slow cooked daily on the premises, and thinly shaved. Just as much love goes into the gravy that you can always see and smell simmering on the stovetop!  The culmination of the perfect blend of spices gives it and the entire sandwich its famous taste.
    Our giant steak burgers are made from the highest quality choice meat and charbroiled to perfection - NEVER PRECOOKED.  Try them on any one of our gourmet pretzel or buttery buns and load them with the freshest garnishes.
    After any satisfying meal, relax and enjoy a truly healthy and refreshing dessert alternative:  Our homemade Italian ice served year round with standards like lemon and black cherry, while offering a rainbow of mouthwatering seasoned picks as they become available:  Pina colada, grape, peach, to name of few, and everyone’s favorite, Watermelon.
    All food items are available for takeout.  Our beef and accompaniments are perfect for your home and office parties of functions, however big or small.  Sold by the pound, our beef is cooked daily without any preservatives or artificial flavorings and packaged the same day.
